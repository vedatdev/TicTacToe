# TicTacToe

At the beginning of the game, it first asks how many squares you want to play.

Then it randomly determines who plays first and the character.

When it's the computer's turn, it randomly puts its character in an empty cell.

When it's your turn, it asks for the row number first and the column number second and puts the character in that cell.

The game is over when there are no empty cells left.
